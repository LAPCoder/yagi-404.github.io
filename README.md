# yagi-404.github.io (My website)
## General informations
This is my website. I'll use it like a README file.
At the time, I don't use it because I don't
have some interesting repos on my GitHub...
But notice that I'll maintain this website 
every time I create a new repo.

## License
No license, totally open source, copyable
and hackable.

## More
Inspired by the FaustinM's website.
